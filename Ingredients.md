Mishti doi is a classic Bengali sweet made with milk, curd culture and jaggery or sugar. The jaggery used traditionally to make mishti doi is palm jaggery. In Bengali language ‘mishti’ means sweet and ‘doi’ is curd. In hindi language mishti doi can be called as meetha dahi.

The method of making mishti doi is different than making a simple curd or dahi. The milk is thickened and reduced first and then palm jaggery is added. When the milk becomes warm, curd is added. This mixture is then allowed to set for some hours.


For making mishti doi its better to use earthen bowls or pans. The porous walls of the earthern bowls absorbs the moisture from the doi, which in turn makes the mishti doi nicely thick.

Mishti doi was and is one of my favorite Bengali sweet. Some 12 to 14 years back in Mumbai, on occasions I would visit one Bengali sweet shop in inorbit mall in malad west. From there I would buy many Bengali sweets and stock them in the fridge. I used to work then, so obviously it was easier for me to buy sweets than make them at home. The simple and yet humble mishti doi would undeniably be one of the sweets I would always buy.

Fermenting mishti doi takes more time as compared to making curd. The timing also varies with the local temperature conditions. If you live in cold climate zones, then keep the curd in a warm place in your house e.g near a heater or inside a lit oven or near the gas stove.

Usually no flavorings are added, but I feel some hints of cardamom powder gives a good aroma as well as flavor to the doi.
